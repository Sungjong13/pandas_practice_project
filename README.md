# Project intro
Upon learning pandas I searched for new/fun datasets that would drive me through writing a new program and found numerous pokemon related datasets online. Using these, I plan to make a pokemon battle simulator that mimics the ingame battle system as close as possible and further use it to develop an AI that searches for the optimal winning pokemon team. Personally I think AI/deeplearning can be used to create better computer player AI in strategy games and hope this first step will continue with my curiosity as fuel.

## Purpose of this project
I am new to python and pandas and this project initially began as practice. Thus codes will be inefficient, insufficient and indistinct. Progress will be made slowly when I have time and motivation.\n I have big and ambiguous plans for the future, although the probabilities of them actually happening is slim at this moment.
